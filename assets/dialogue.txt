[Intro]
There once lived a mate so boring
Who compared to none but his flooring
He decided one day
To throw it all away
And set out into the wild exploring

While his ignorance is naught but endless
And he is caught in a rut that is friendless
His grit was unmatched
And his chain unlatched
He thought himself a legend, deathless
